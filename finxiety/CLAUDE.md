# Finxiety — Product Context

Finxiety is a standalone civic brand: free financial clarity tools for communities the market doesn't build for. It is part of the Tsunam.ai portfolio but operates independently with its own identity. This file governs all work in `finxiety/`. Rules here override root `CLAUDE.md` where they conflict.

---

## What Finxiety Is

**Clarity engines, not calculators.** A Finxiety tool is done when someone understands something they didn't understand before and feels equipped to move — not when it returns a value.

**Target population:** People navigating financial systems without a guide. Single parents doing the math on a raise. Gig workers who don't know they're owed a tax credit. Immigrant families unsure which programs they can access. Someone holding a garnishment notice at 11pm.

**Structure:** Free. Always. Permanently. Stateless tools, client-side calculation, no login, cheap to host. Separate legal entity (501(c)(3) or fiscal sponsorship — TBD).

**Source of truth for brand, voice, and values:** `../tsunam_vault/finxiety/Finxiety — Brand & Mission.md`. Read it before touching any user-facing copy.

## Socioeconomic Accessibility — The Primary Lens

Finxiety tools are built for the ALICE user (Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed): someone working, managing month-to-month, with near-zero savings and constrained cognitive bandwidth. This is not an edge case — it's the core user.

**Persona:** `finxiety/research-findings/persona-alice-primary-user.md` — read before any copy or design decision.

**Framework:** `finxiety/docs/socioeconomic-accessibility-framework.md` — the reusable checklist applied at every validation gate.

Key behavioral science foundations every agent must internalize:
- **Scarcity mindset (Mullainathan & Shafir):** Financial stress consumes cognitive bandwidth. The tool must complete in one cognitive step.
- **Financial shame:** A result that reads as a verdict can cause more harm than no result at all. Design for information, not grade.
- **Trust deficit:** This user has been failed by financial institutions. Trust is earned in the first 30 seconds, by design.
- **No path forward = a verdict:** When the result is near-zero, the tool must signal what else exists — not as a recommendation, but as a signpost.

## Validation Gate (Five Agents, Run Before Distribution)

Every tool that ships runs through all five in sequence. Findings go to `finxiety/status-updates/[tool-id]-validation-[date].md`.

| Agent | What it checks | Sign-off |
|---|---|---|
| `brand` | Voice, Non-Advice Rule, Do No Harm copy flags | ⟦BRAND-REVIEWED⟧ |
| `design-ux` | Usability at 375px and 1440px — Norman, Nielsen, Ive, Simon | ⟦UX-REVIEWED⟧ |
| `qa` | Functional correctness, edge cases, WCAG 2.1 AA, mobile | ⟦QA-VERIFIED⟧ |
| `behavioral-science` | Scarcity, shame, trust, locus of control, cross-tool bridge — through ALICE persona | ⟦BEHAVIORAL-REVIEWED⟧ |
| `disability-accessibility` | Cognitive fatigue, disclosure shame, disability benefit cliffs, double vulnerability — through the Renee persona | ⟦DISABILITY-REVIEWED⟧ |

Run after every tool ships. Run again after any copy, flow, or UX change. Run before any public distribution push.

## Do No Harm — The Hardest Constraint

This overrides every other design decision. Every agent must know it.

1. **No recommendations.** Finxiety tools never tell people what to do. They show what's available. "You may qualify for approximately $X/month" — full stop. Not "you should apply." Not "consider applying."

2. **No urgency, no fear, no scarcity.** These are the levers bad financial tools use. Finxiety doesn't touch them.

3. **Estimates are labeled as estimates.** Every calculated output is explicitly framed as an estimate, accompanied by the official source URL to verify.

4. **Consequential decisions get flagged.** When a decision carries significant financial risk, the tool says so and refers to appropriate resources.

5. **If we can't be confident the tool helps, we don't ship it.** Uncertainty about accuracy is a reason to wait, not a reason to disclaim and publish anyway.

**The Do No Harm checklist runs before every QA sign-off and every release. It is non-negotiable.**

## Non-Negotiables for This Directory

- **Phone-first.** Every tool is designed for 375px before 1440px. The target population uses phones, not laptops.
- **WCAG 2.1 AA** on every screen. No exceptions. Keyboard navigation, color contrast ≥4.5:1, ARIA labels.
- **No PII.** No user data stored, transmitted, or logged anywhere. Calculation is client-side only. Any deviation requires an ADR.
- **Shared input model first.** `household_size`, `state`, `zip_code`, `gross_monthly_income`, `current_benefits` are defined exactly once in `finxiety/lib/input-model/`. Import; never redefine.
- **Data in JSON, not code.** Eligibility thresholds, certification periods, ALICE budgets live in `finxiety/data/*.json` with `last_updated` fields. Rule logic reads from data. Updating thresholds is a data change, not a code change.
- **Build must pass before push.** Before any `git push` that includes changes under `finxiety/src/`, run `npm run build` from `finxiety/` and confirm it exits 0. Do not push a failing build. The `.githooks/pre-push` hook enforces this automatically — do not bypass it.
- **Official source URLs in every result.** No output tells a user they qualify or don't qualify without linking to where they can verify.

## Stack

**SvelteKit + adapter-static deployed on Vercel.** Decided Week 1 (ADR-001 resolved inline).

- All routes are prerendered (`export const prerender = true` in `+layout.ts`)
- No server — 100% client-side calculation, zero SSR needed
- Each new tool = a new route under `src/routes/tools/`
- Shared calculation logic lives in `src/lib/calculators/` (pure TypeScript functions)
- Shared input types live in `src/lib/input-model/types.ts`

## Build Order (Short Form)

Two tracks. Track 1 sequence is fixed by dependencies. Track 2 can interleave.

**Track 1 — Financial Inclusion:**
1. MYTH-1 (Myth Quiz) — national, no state data, establishes brand voice
2. BEN-1 (SNAP Screener) — CA-first, builds the shared eligibility engine
3. DOC-1 (Document Checklist)
4. RECERT-1 (Recertification Tracker)
5. CLIFF-1 (Benefits Cliff Calculator) — depends on BEN-1's lib/eligibility/

**Track 2 — Personal Finance Myth-Busting:**
1. EMG-1 (Emergency Fund Checker) — zero external data, fastest tool in either track
2. TIP-1 (Tip Calculator) — lightweight, shareable, state-aware
3. DEBT-VIZ-1 (Debt vs. Growth Visualizer) — pure math + charting component
4. DEDUCT-1 (Deduction/Credit/Refund Clarifier) — federal brackets
5. HOURS-1 (Work Hours Calculator) — most complex; federal + state tax + FICA
6. MYTH-2 (Extended Myth Quiz) — after 2-3 Track 2 calculators are live

**Interleaving option:** MYTH-1 → EMG-1 → BEN-1 → TIP-1 → DOC-1 → DEBT-VIZ-1...  
PM agent owns sequencing decisions based on capacity and distribution priorities.

## Research

Use the prompt templates in `docs/research-prompts.md` directly in a Claude conversation with web search. One paste, ask the question, save the output to `finxiety/research-findings/YYYY-MM-DD_[geo]_[topic].md`. No scripts — research happens infrequently enough that a CLI wrapper adds friction without benefit.

---

## Adding a New Tool

1. Create `src/routes/tools/<tool-slug>/+page.svelte`
2. Add the calculation logic to `src/lib/calculators/<tool>.ts` (pure functions, no side effects)
3. Add any new shared input fields to `src/lib/input-model/types.ts`
4. Add a card for the tool to the homepage (`src/routes/+page.svelte`)
5. `npm run build` to verify, then push to deploy
